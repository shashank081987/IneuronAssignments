Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function? 
Ans. String
Q8. What is type casting? 
Ans. Converting one data type to another is type casting
Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why? 
Ans. Using num1, num2, num3 = input(“Enter three numbers”).split()
Q10. What are keywords? 
Ans. keywords are some predefined and reserved words in python that have special meanings. Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding.
Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

Ans. iNeuron * 4
Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even. 
Ans.
print("Enter a number:")
number = int(input())
print(number)
if(number % 2 == 0):
    print("Entered number " + str(number) + " is even")
else:
    print("Entered number " + str(number) + " is odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator? 
Ans. True, False, Not, and, or are Boolean operators
Q19. What will the output of the following? 1 or 0 0 and 0 True and False and True 1 or 0 or 0

True and False and True = False
1 or 0 or 0 = 1
Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

print("Enter the age of person:")
age = int(input())
if(age >= 18):
    print("I can vote")
else:
    print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list. numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50] 
Ans. Required Topic not taught till now
Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output. 
Ans.
num1, num2, num3 = input("Enter three nos.").split()
num1 = int(num1)
num2 = int(num2)
num3 = int(num3)
if (num1 >= num2) and (num1 >= num3):
    print("Gretest no is num1")
elif (num2 >= num1) and (num2 >= num3):
    print("Gretest no is num2")
else:
    print("Gretest no is num3")

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions • The number must be divisible by five • If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number • If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
